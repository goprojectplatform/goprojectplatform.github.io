            Project Platform was created for one reason only. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline">To give
                people a platform on the internet.</span> <br>We believe that
            plain resumes can be transformed into beautiful sites which represent more than a piece of paper can.

        <p>
            At Project Platform, we offer two services. A single page website, or a multi page website, based off how
            detailed you'd prefer your website to be. All of our services are completely free-of-charge, and we do not
            accept any payment. However, there may be a wait to get a service in a case with a high volume of requests.
